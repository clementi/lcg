# lcg

A simple, demonstrative linear congruential generator for generating pseudorandom numbers, derived from that provided by Donald Knuth in his _[The Art of Computer Programming](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html)_.

To compile and run it on a Unix-like system, run `make run`. You should get output like the following:

```
int64    : -4566885001758647346
uint64   : 14650153270070761093
int32    : -1980438121
uint32   : 2468198263
double   : 0.197517401382339
float    : 0.1769153
char     : -55
```
